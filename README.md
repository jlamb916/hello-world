First step to learning Github!

Hello World!

Theres a boy from Sacramento who's new to the git game. He's young, He's fast, He's pretty. He's only just begun but the whole words watching him. His names John Lam and he just might be the greatest GITHUBBER OF ALL TIME!

This little tutorial taught me the first steps to working with Github.
I learned:
- How to create an open source repository.
- How to manage and start a new branch. 
- Changed a file and commited changes to Github.
- Opened and merged a Pull Request.


Tutorial time: 5 minutes

This short tutorial is well a brief guide to using github to manage and edit work repositories. It teaches the user how to upload a repository, create a copy of the master branch, and manipulate the copy without affecting the main branch. After the edits have been made and completed you are then able to commit the changes and open a pull request. This allows a team to work together on a project and ensure that the correct edits are being made. These features are a intuitive way to maintain and work on projects by yourself or on a team!
